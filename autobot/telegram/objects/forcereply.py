    Upon receiving a message with this object, 
    Telegram clients will display a reply interface 
    to the user (act as if the user has selected the 
    bot's message and tapped 'Reply'). This can be extremely 
    useful if you want to create user-friendly step-by-step 
    interfaces without having to sacrifice privacy mode.

    Args:
        force_reply (:obj:`bool`): Shows reply interface to the user, as if they manually selected the bot's message and tapped 'Reply'
        selective (:obj:`bool`): Optional. Use this parameter if you want to force reply from specific users only. Targets: 1) 
        users that are @mentioned in the text of the Message object; 2) if the bot's message is a reply (has reply_to_message_id), 
        sender of the original message.
        input_field_placeholder (:obj:`str`): Optional. The placeholder to be shown in the input field when the reply is active; 1-64 characters
